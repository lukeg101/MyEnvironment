# Putty Configuration
If you happen to use windows remotely, and want to retain something similar to what you have on a linux machine:
- Set Connection > Data > terminal-type string to `xterm-256color`
- Optional: Set Connection > Data > Auto-login username to the login on the machine you are accessing
- Set Terminal > Bell to off
- Set Window > Appearance Allow selection of variable pitch fonts
- Set Solarised Dark theme in Window > Colours, using [this](https://superuser.com/questions/640225/putty-solarized-the-manual-way) guide.
- Set Connection > seconds between keepalives to 30
- Save this config in the Session tab for reuse

# Colorscheme - Solarised Dark
This is easy on the eyes, the pygmalion font used by oh my zsh uses [this](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) too.
- The vim guide for the colorscheme is above
